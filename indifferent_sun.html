<h1>Under an Indifferent Sun</h1>
<p>Have you ever grown ponderous when idle, perhaps over tea which has cooled in your hands without your awareness, so that you are returned to the room you are in fact sitting in when the strange and unexpected metallic taste of cold porcelain kisses your tongue, and considered how a spec of wood may splinter into a man's hand as he runs his palm along an unsanded bannister?</p>
<p>Even though it is a mere nuisance, if he is a crafstman of fine wares, one who repairs delicate clockwork, for instance, or a jeweller, the splinter can temporarily debilitate his entire arm, so that he must wear it in a silng and forgoe his customary business operations and routine.</p>
<p>If a customer then arrives at the shop and finds it deserted, but locates the craftsman in a nearby tavern, and pressures him to repair a rare and valued trinket or piece of memorabilia for use in an imminent family ritual, the tradesman may, drunk from beer, agree but in the end destroy or damage the object by hasty and maladroit movements of his wounded hand.</p>
<p>Then what recourse will the customer have? Except to bow onto the street and curse his own impatient and impertinent behavior!</p>
<p>So it is with those who heedlessly engage in manly discourse, destroying by importunity what they had hoped to salvage and quicken. Their chosen vessel now falls to the ground a cracked bauble, whom neither wisdom nor anything can restore.</p>
<p>I am in such a mood Today, and must confess, if it be allowed, that mockers and scoffers, whose manners and dispositions are well known, but whose reasons, means, and methods of penetrating mind and memory are not, and who disgust and sicken the mind's eye even more than a cut slug's wayward path to the bottom of an empty glass, gasping for air as if to beg the drinker for one final sip, have begun to tug and reel at a hook still in me, barbed and therefore unremovable from the spotted, foul, and sun eaten flesh of my vile and spat on pride, so that I must answer for my squeamish tears or else shed them in silence.</p>
<p>Know then, since silence has fled, that I have not wept in sorrow but rather in mourning, which is a blessed and blissful state, ever encircled, if not by Angels then their light, since it is mingled, suffused, soaked through, remember this, with Love.</p>
<p>Finally, I do not call a flower a rose because it is red, for many are red but are no roses. Nor do I call a white rose by another name and strip him of the title "rose," for though he has chosen to display the drops of dew which daily moisten his neck and body as if they were sharp diamonds, speckling through him like needles through silk... or perfumed sweat from invisible glands... the simplest of intellects will immediately confess that dewdrops remain what they always were: the momentary reflections of a higher essence, overflowing from the utterly extravagant care of an innocent yet knowing wind. Therefore if I do see a red rose, and call it what it is, red, and a rose, please understand me. It is a rose and can be none other, at which I bend to inhale, pause breifly, and walk away.</p>
